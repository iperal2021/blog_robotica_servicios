## AMAZON WEREHOUSE

The objective of this practice is to implement the logic that allows a logistics robot to deliver shelves to the required place by making use of the location of the robot. The robot is equipped with a map and knows its current location in it. The main objective will be to find the shortest path to complete the task.

Another goal is to leran how to use the *OMPL* library.

## PLANING

To start planing I need to get the conversion of the coordinate from *3D* to *2D*. This time the exercise give us all the measurements of the map in both spaces. Once the transformation is correct is time to learn wich functionas of *OMPL* I have to use and what does each one.

Using the example from the documentation I can try to define the start point and the objetive coordinates to try the planner.
