## MARKED BASED VISUAL LOCALIZATION

The goal of this exercise is to estimate the position and orientation (pose) of a robot in a 2D space by detecting and analyzing visual markers, specifically AprilTags. This process involves using computer vision to identify the tags in the robotâ€™s environment and mathematical methods to derive its relative pose with respect to the detected tags.
